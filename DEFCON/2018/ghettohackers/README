ghettohackers: Throwback
A guest challenge from ghettohackers!

This one is a throwback to those retro CTFs of yore.

Flag format is nonstandard, there are no brackets.

Hint: The flag is in the format ([a-z ]+)

Hint: Some might call this challenge a stego challenge, or possibly a baby baby crypto.

Hint: The flag is two English words separated by a space.
